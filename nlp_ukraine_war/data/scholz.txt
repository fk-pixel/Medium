Mr. President,
Secretary-General,
Fellow delegates, 
Ladies and gentlemen,

It is with humility and deep respect that I am addressing you today – both as the newly elected Chancellor of Germany and as a proud delegate to our United Nations.

My country and the United Nations are indivisibly linked.

Today’s democratic and reunited Germany owes its role on the world stage to you, our international friends and partners.

You placed your trust in us to become and to remain a peace-loving member of the international community.

We know that we owe our freedom, our stability and our prosperity to an international order with the United Nations at its core.

Therefore, my country’s commitment to this organisation and its noble goals – peace, development and equal rights and dignity for every human being – will never wane.

Unfortunately, I’m expressing this commitment at a time during which we’re getting further away from these noble goals.

After decades during which we overcame walls and blocs – a time in which we marked the fall of the Iron Curtain and German reunification – 
after the technological revolution of the internet and the digital transformation, which have made us more interconnected than ever before, we are now facing a new fragmentation of the world.

New wars and conflicts have emerged. Major global crises are piling up before us and are combining and reinforcing one another.

Some have even seen this as a harbinger of a world without rules.

It’s true that the risks to our global order are real.

And yet I don’t hold with the image of a world without rules – for two reasons:

Firstly, our world has clear rules. 
Rules that we, the United Nations, created together. 

This Charter promises all of us freedom and peaceful coexistence.

This Charter is our collective rejection of a world without rules.

Our problem isn’t the absence of rules. Our problem is the lack of willingness to abide by and enforce them. 

But the image of a world without rules leads us astray for a second reason.

If we don’t defend, further develop and strengthen our global order together, then it isn’t chaos without rules that we face, but a world in which the rules are made by those who can dictate them to us by dint of their military, economic or political power.

The alternative to a rules-based world isn’t anarchy, but the dominion of the strong over the weak.

The vast majority of us cannot be indifferent to whether the rule of power or the power of rules wins the day.

The key question that we as an international community face is this: should we stand helplessly by and watch as some seek to cast us back into a global order in which war is a common instrument of politics; 
in which independent nations have to submit to their stronger neighbours or their colonial masters; 
in which prosperity and human rights are a privilege of the lucky few?

Or will we manage to stand together and ensure that the multipolar world of the 21st century remains a multilateral world?

My answer, as a German and a European is this: we have to manage this.

And we will manage this if we take three fundamental principles to heart.

***

Firstly, the international order doesn’t happen by itself. If we do nothing, then this Charter is but a piece of paper.

This Charter calls on all of us to uphold its purposes and principles.

We mustn’t stand idly by when a major nuclear power armed to the teeth – a founding member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the UN Security Council no less – seeks to shift borders through the use of violence.

There is no justification whatsoever for Russia’s war of occupation against Ukraine.

President Putin is waging this war with one single objective: to seize Ukraine.

Self-determination and political independence do not count for him.

There is only one word for this. This is imperialism plain and simple!

The return of imperialism is not only a disaster for Europe. 

It is also a disaster for our global peaceful order, which is the antithesis of imperialism and neo-colonialism.

That’s why it was so important that, here in this room, 141 countries categorically condemned Russia’s war of occupation.

But that alone isn’t enough!

If we want this war to end, then we cannot be indifferent to how it ends.

Putin will only give up his war and his imperialist ambitions if he realises that he cannot win.

In so doing, he isn’t just destroying Ukraine but is also ruining his own country.

This is why we will not accept a peace dictated by Russia – and we will not accept any sham referendums either.

This is why Ukraine must be able to defend itself against Russia’s invasion.

We’re supporting Ukraine with all our might – financially, economically, with humanitarian assistance, and also with weapons.

Together with our partners around the world, we have imposed tough economic sanctions on the Russian leadership and Russia’s economy.

This is how we are making good on a promise that each and every of our countries made when joining the United Nations, namely to join forces “to maintain international peace and security”.

There’s one more thing that I would like to add, which is that not one sack of grain has been held back on account of these sanctions.

Russia alone has prevented Ukrainian grain ships from putting out to sea, bombing ports and destroying agricultural enterprises.

„Who proscribes war also has to proscribe hunger“.

My predecessor, Nobel Peace Prize winner Willy Brandt, said this when he addressed this Assembly, as the first Federal Chancellor to do so, in 1973. 

Today, we are witnessing that this sentence also works the other way around.

Who proscribes hunger has to proscribe the Russian war – this war, which even in countries far away from Russia is leading to rising prices, energy scarcity and famine.

The fact that grain exports have been made possible once again thanks to the mediation efforts of Secretary-General Guterres and Turkey deserves great respect.

Germany is also supporting Ukraine with the export of food.

And we will stand by Ukraine when it comes to shouldering the enormous costs for rebuilding the country.

At an international expert conference, which I’m hosting with the President of the European Commission in Berlin on 25 October, we will, together with supporters of Ukraine from all around the world, think about how we can manage this Herculean task.

Our message is this: we stand firmly at the side of those under attack.

For the protection of the lives and the freedom of the Ukrainians.

And for the protection of our international order.

(interview)
I think he cares, but he will not really admit it. So you get some idea--

you get some idea that it really is hurting him and that he understands the deep impacts of our sanctions on his economy. And I'm always mentioning it because it's necessary to say it. This is now happening to a country that is not that advanced, that is really needing all the technologies from the rest of the world for having a similar standard of living and for having the chance to be part of growth in the world economy. And this is now the real damage to the Russian economy that they have no chance to do this.

No one really knows. He has-- he is perhaps the leader of a very great country with a lot of people living there, with a lot of means, and he is really doing this brutal war with-- and he prepared for it very long, so he will be able to continue with the war really a long time.

 I think that all what we do will help to give him the view that this is not working and that he will not be successful. 

So we took a very, very hard decision to change political strategies we followed for many decades

never to deliver weapons into a country that is in a conflict. When we decide, for instance, to send the most modern Howitzer which you can buy on the world market, which is in use in Germany, it was very difficult to organize that this could be used in the war because you have to have some training. And we had Ukrainian soldiers in Germany, and when the training ended, in the end they came with the weapon-with-with the Howitzers to Ukraine, and the

-I think you should understand that there is a difference if a country like the United States spends that much for defense, which is a very big investment, and you have a lot of weapons at your stocks. Together with the United States, and the United Kingdom, we decided to deliver multi-rocket launchers to Ukraine now, which are--

We are sending them and we are doing it with the means and ways we have, and with the training. And once again, there are a lot of very experienced people who yesterday looked at Google and today they know how to do things. We will always see that Germany is one of the countries that is doing the most, because what we are sending now is the most sophisticated technology you can use. There is also antiballistic- there are also weapons we give to the- to the Ukraine that they can defend the air-

-that they can defend the city from- against the rockets and missiles that were sent there from Putin. And this is very expensive and very effective technology, but they will get it

this will help a country like Odes- to support, to-to defend the country, a city like Odessa or Kyiv. 

Those who are looking to the facts, see that we are doing what is feasible we are changing the way how we spend money for defense. And this is the big increase which will change the situation and will give us the chance to be more quick in reaction to a threat that is coming to NATO, the alliance, or to our country. 

He cannot buy anything from the money he's getting from us because he will- he has all these sanctions on imports for modern technologies and things he is looking for. So this is what is making very angry. But to be very clear, when we decided on sanctions, together, and with all our allies, we said always, we will do it in a way that we harm Putin more than us. And many countries in Europe are depending, for historical reasons and because they are near to the place, and it is the nearest place to get the gas--on the imports of gas. And when now, the whole of Europe is deciding to go out of this dependence, this will change the scenario, even on the world market.

But he cannot buy

It is always decreasing. And I, once again, say that we decided that we do the sanc- that we draft the sanctions in the way that they hurt Putin and this is what we do. And, once again, we are now doing real investments into technology, in pipelines, in ports. And I know there people that sometimes think that when you are having taken a decision one afternoon, the next morning you have a port and a 40-kilometers pipeline--

but in the real life, this is not happening. When Europe is deciding to go out of the import of, of gas from Russia, this will have consequences.

A hundred

Hundred-- this is

 This is obviously the case. And this is why I was starting to discuss the question what to do if the gas delivery will be reduced right when I entered office. We should be very much prepared that we will have high energy prices all over the world in all countries

It is not- it will be very tough if we will have a shortage of energy supplies. Obviously, all our countries, all our- all our life is depending on the supply of energy. And obviously, a lot of countries, the most countries of the world are depending on the supply from abroad. And so we have to prepare for a difficult situation

You're very right. The shortages of food many people in the world are seeing now as a threat to them, are the direct consequence of what Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the war he is imposing on the country. You're right that all the rising energy prices are also a direct consequence of his doing. And he is- he is the one that is doing the wrong things. And we are always discussing this with our partners around the globe. We are starting an initiative to support countries that have not enough food with food.

We are now collecting money for supporting the poorest countries that they will be able to deliver food to the people. And this is our international initiative, we- we organized together with others for food security, and we will continue to do that. 

It is a real problem, and it is a real consequence of Putin's war and this is why it is even more necessary that we support the people.

The conflict will end when Putin understands that he will not be successful with idea to conquer part of the territory of his neighbor.

I think it was not right that we were not prepared to have at any time the chance to change the one that is delivering gas, oil and coal to us. So we should have invested all over Europe in infrastructure that gives us the ability to change the supply from one day to the other. And I think this is the lesson that has been learned in Europe and in many other places that you have to be prepared- be prepared for a situation like this. 

We should be clear about these threats that are coming to our future. And this is coming from autocracies, yes, because they tend to be aggressive. And this is an aspect we should be very much aware of. And I am. And this is why I organized our meeting we had in Germany with the G7 group of democratic- economically successful democratic states that we invite partners from all over the globe that are also democracies for making it happen. That the democracies are strong.

This is. And it's necessary

Russia started a very brutal aggression against Ukraine. A lot of people are dying in Ukraine, citizens, men, women, children, elderly people. And this is what we call a really brutal, unjustified war that has- that Russia started. And we have to do all to support Ukraine, and to give Ukraine the chance to defend its own integrity and serenity. And that is what we are doing when we support the country.

It achieves something when we support Ukraine with all the financial means we give to the Ukraine, with all the humanitarian aid, with all the weapons we deliver. And we will continue doing this as long as it is necessary for supporting Ukraine, and for avoiding that the outcome of this war is what Putin is looking for: a dictated peace. And this is something that neither the Ukraine nor we will accept. So it is necessary that we continue with this very strong support. And it is necessary that we also continue with all the sanctions we imposed on Russia. And this is an important aspect from my- as I see it. We impose sanctions against one Russia after the election of Crimea, not too many, but we did-- 

And they are still in place. We imposed sanctions against Russia when they organize the uprisings in the east of Donbass in Ukraine, and they are still in place. And all the very heavy sanctions we impose on Russia now will be there, if there is not a real fair piece from the perspective of Ukraine, and this is the message I sent to Putin and many others do the same. And we make it very clear, you cannot look for a dictate piece against Ukraine

Peace is only something we can take for granted if we are prepared to defend it. This is the lesson that we have learned from the brutal Russian attack on Ukraine

The greater the pressure from the outside, the more we join forces as the European Union and act together

We all share one goal, Russia must not win this war, Ukraine must prevail

A brutally attacked country needs help in defending itself and doing so cannot be termed escalation

Friends in Sweden and Finland, you are most cordially welcome. With you on our side NATO will become even stronger and Europe even safer

We as the European Union must pave the way for a solidarity fund fed by membership fees from the European Union and our international partners. That way we will help the Ukrainians to clear the destruction and to rebuild

"It is my firm conviction that we will overcome the impacts here in Europe and across the globe, because we here are a strong country, we have strong partners and strong alliances

But also, because we know what we are defending: peace, liberty, and rule of law.

But now, "Putin wants to overthrow Ukraine and destroy its culture and identity... [and] even regards his barbaric war of aggression as being on a par with the fight against National Socialism

That is a falsification of history and a disgraceful distortion. We have an obligation to state this clearly

Germany would not take unilateral action. "Whatever we do, we coordinate closely with our Alliance partners

Thirdly, we will not do anything that could inflict more damage on ourselves and our partners than on Russia

"And fourthly: we will not take any decision that makes NATO a party to the war. We stand by these principles

For in the oath I took upon assuming office, I swore to protect the German people from harm. That includes protecting our country and our allies from danger

Freedom and security will win the day

just as freedom and security triumphed over oppression, violence, and dictatorship 77 years ago
